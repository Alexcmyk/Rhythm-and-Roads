              The Good Life native Olivia Taphorn is the founder of the music supervision company Rhythm &amp; Roads. Olivia’s passion for music in
              film led her to leave her job in Finance and head back to school at Berklee College of Music to pursue a career in Music Supervision.
              Right out of the gate, Olivia started working on a military documentary, a superhero TV pilot, and advertisements all while working
              remote during the pandemic.

              Prior to founding R&amp;R, Olivia worked for Diamondisc Audio, a music publisher in Nashville, where she honed her skills in music
              curation, licensing and sync. Following that experience, she opened R&amp;R’s doors and is now an independent music supervisor for US
              and International film, TV and advertising. R&amp;R’s aligned with top music libraries, publishers and labels all around the world to
              meet any project’s music needs. R&amp;R is ready to hit the ground running for projects looking to work with a young, creative,
              motivated, fresh-eyed and knowledgeable female music supervisor.
