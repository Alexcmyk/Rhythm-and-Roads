              The Job is a faith based film about a boxer who killed his opponent in the ring. Five years after losing everything, the "Fallen from
              grace" champion, Lance "The Dance" Foster finds faith in God and vows never to be violent again. Abe is a desperate young husband and
              father to a son born with a life threatening disease. After losing his job, his health insurance, and his faith, Abe breaks into Lance's
              home in hopes of finding something valuable to pawn to take care of his ailing family. Thing is...Lance wasn't supposed to be there.
              This fated meeting leads these two men down a path of redemption, forgiveness, and what may be, the toughest fight of Lance's
              life...saving Abe's.
